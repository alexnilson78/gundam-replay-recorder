Usage:
Pull repo and configure the script.
- Adjust recording hotkeys.
- Adjust expected locations for screen detection.
Compile the script.
Launch PS4 Remote Play and connect to your PS4
Launch Gundam Versus and navigate to your replay list.
Scroll down to one replay before the group you want to record.
- Replays will get recorded until there are no newer replays to record. i.e., until we can't scroll any higher in the list.
Run the compiled script and come back later.
